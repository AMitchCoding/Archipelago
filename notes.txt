Notes:




The armory guard room and the room above have fake layers. Maybe not???



Notes 2:
(Fixed)  this is 0060 but looks like should be 0460 layer again
(Fixed) Wrong layer for Compass room WN?
(Fixed partially )Guardroom N Door is set to $8000, I think it was supposed to be Eastern Compass Area SW $02a8 that how this get teleported back to HC. Wrong room index. Still might be a toggle door
(Fixed) Courtyard N is set to $02D8 - typo
(Fixed) Sanc N is $0650 but should be $0250 which I think is right. typo again on the wrong layer
(Fixed) Eastern boss had wrong room
