# Features

Mirror Scroll no longer erases blocks, the real mirror still will. (Sorry!)
Standard+Crossed Dungeon now gives you a little magic, a few bombs, and a few arrows if you die or S&Q after meeting your uncle (also works with mirror/scroll)

# Bug Fixes

Splashing at hobo no longer prevents you from buying bomb capacity upgrades
Small vitreous eyeballs will not drop items (DR basic and crossed only)
In Vanilla doors the HC back hallway area was broken - should be better now
