# Features

Mirror Scroll no longer erases blocks, the real mirror still will. (Sorry!)
Standard+Crossed Dungeon now gives you a little magic, a few bombs, and a few arrows if you die or S&Q after meeting your uncle (also works with mirror/scroll)
Dungeon reminder added to hud for Crossed dungeons
Blinking red square added to hud and it indicates a boss room is close by. Only appears if you have the compass. (Basic & Crossed)

## Map Features (Crossed only)

    Key counters added to hud. Indicates number of keys in chests: found/total)
    Big Key indicator added to hud. Indicates if BK is not in the dungeon, or if BnC guard has it
    Total key indicator added to hud if you have found the map. Counts down from the total number of keys in dungeon to 0 as you collect them.

# Bug Fixes

Splashing at hobo no longer prevents you from buying bomb capacity upgrades
Small vitreous eyeballs will not drop items (DR basic and crossed only)
In Vanilla doors the HC back hallway area was broken - should be better now
