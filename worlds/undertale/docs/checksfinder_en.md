# Undertale Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Undertale from the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540)
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
    - (select `Undertale Client` during installation.)

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the [Undertale Player Settings Page](../player-settings)

### Generating a Undertale game

When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your YAML file to whoever is hosting. 
Once that is done, you will be able to connect to the server.

### First time setup

Start the Undertale client, and in the bottom text box, input `/auto_patch (Input your Steam directory here)`, usually 
your steam directory is usually it is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`, it will then patch your installation of 
Undertale in the Undertale folder that will be created in the Archipelago install location. That is the Undertale 
installation you will use for Archipelago.

### Connect to the MultiServer

Make sure both Undertale and its client are running.

In the top text box of the client, type the 
`Ip Address` and `Port` separated with a `:` symbol.

The client will then ask for the yaml name, input that in the text box at the bottom of the client.

### Play the game

When the console tells you that you have joined the room, you're all set. Congratulations on successfully joining a
multiworld game!
